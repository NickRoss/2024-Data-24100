# Week #4 Lesson Plan

## Overview
- Monday night the next part of the project is required to be turned in.
- Thursday there will be a quiz. Quizzes are cumulative and cover the material up-to and including the previous week (Week 3).

## Resources

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and write code that adhere to the following best practices. 
  - DRY
  - File organization
  - Separation of concerns
- What is a decorator in Python and why do we use them?
- Be able to write a decorator that implements logic before and after a function is called.
- Work with functions as objects.
- Positional vs. Keyword arguments: How are they different. How to pack and unpack with (`*` and `**`). How to use them to pass arbitrary argument information to functions.

[Day 8](../class_notes/08_flask_soc.md)

## Quizzable Concepts

- You will _not_ be expected to reproduce a decorator from scratch, but you should be able to read the code in a decorator, interpret what it is doing and make minor modifications.
- Define positional vs. keyword arguments.
- Describe and use `**kwargs` and `*args` for manipulating unknown or variable length arguments.
- Be able to use `__name__`, `__doc__` and `__module__` on functions and know what the result is.
- Define separation of concerns and code complexity.
