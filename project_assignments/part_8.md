# Project Part #8: Final Submission

This document outlines the requirements for the final part of our project.

### Coding Standards

During the quarter, you will be expected to adhere to the coding standards found [here](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/coding-standards/coding-standards.md) and we will frequently use [this rubric](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/rubrics/final-technical-cleanup.md) as a checklist for your code.

### Branches

When you submit the code, there should only be _a single branch_ with the name `main`. All other branches need to be deleted.

### Grading

All grading will be done based off a specific commit hash off of the main branch. At the time that an assignment is due students must submit the commit hash associated with their commit to Canvas. You need to submit the _full_ commit hash which is a 40 digit long hash of letters and numbers. It will generally look something like this: `2a2a59af9feacbdd2cd772884b24641c3b75dff7`.

To find the commit hash, you can either use the command line or check GitHubâ€™s commit history.

Note that any changes requested in the grading of the previous part need to be corrected.

## Part VIII: Adding Tests and Autodocs

- Your code must conform to all the requirements of all previous parts, including [Part VII](./part_7.md) 

### Autodocs

Using the `mkdocs` package please set up autodocs. Similar to the lecture example, please create:

  1. An `about` page which includes your names and _light_ biographical details. By light, I mean only what you are willing to share publicly. Or you can just make up a short bio. You should make this look nice and use some `html` tags to organize it. You will be graded on making it look professional and clean. A wall of text without any formatting or text with grammar and other readability errors will result in a lower grade.
  2. An `index` page which contains a brief description of the project and what you have done. This should be short and sweet -- but also look nice. Please add at least one image, using `html` tags to make the image look well formatted.
  3. A `docs` page consisting of documentation generated from the code. _All_ functions need to be accessible via the docs (including functions from the test), so verify that all files were appropriately processed. Note: This documentation needs to be well written: it should be descriptive of what the code is doing. While there are quite a few "boilerplate" functions that will not need any description beyond a sentence, functions which contain logic should be explained. 

Please refer to the notes about how to set up autodocs. When the autodoc server is run it should be accessible on port 4040. The autodoc server should be accessed via `make autodoc`. 

### Tests

Leveraging the `pytest` library, please write end-to-end tests for every `v1`, `v2` and `v4` route. NOTE: This does **NOT** include `v3` routes. 

For each route you need to write a schema test using `jsonschema` library. This should be a complete schema for what is returned and should include status code. There are 3 `v1` routes (0-2), 5 `v2` routes (3-7) and `v4` route (8), for a total of 9 test functions.

NOTE: When you name the test, please use a naming convention which identifies the route based on the numbers above. So the `v1` routes should have names like `test_0_v1_row_count`, `test_1_v1_...`, `test_2_v1_..` where the enumerated numbers align with the numbers in parenthesis above. 

Please also write tests which do the following:
- Send a request without any API Key and verify what is returned is correct (for one `v1` route, one `v2` route and the `v4` route). In other words this is three different calls, but _within a single test function_. This is a single test function (test number 9).
- Send a request against the `/api/v2/{YEAR}` with an incorrect year (such as 1980) and verify that it returns the correct status code. This is a single test function (test number 10).
- Send a request with an invalid API Key and verify what is returned is correct (for one `v1` route, one `v2` route and the `v4` route). In other words this is three different calls, but _within a single test function_. This is a single test function (test number 11).
- For the `v4` back-testing route, please write an exact, explicit test. In this case what I mean is that you calculate an actual expected (non-zero, non-empty) value of a specific back test and then verify that the numbers, not just the schema are correct. This is a single test function (test number 12)

- Adding up the above, There should be 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  = 13 test functions in your test suite. Please make sure to name them properly. All of these tests should both reflect the rubric as well as pass.

- In terms of names they should all follow the convention: `test_{test-number:int}_{whatever you want to name it}`. You can name them whatever you would like as long as it follows good naming practices.

- You will also need to instal `pytest-cov` to have the coverage report created, which is required. 

- You can find a breakdown of all tests and their numbers in the chart here:

| Test Number | Route | Info | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `/api/v1/row_count` | Schema Test | 
| 1 | `/api/v1/unique_stock_count` | Schema Test | 
| 2 | `/api/v1/row_by_market_count` | Schema Test | 
| 3 | `/api/v2/{YEAR}` | Schema Test | 
| 4 | `/api/v2/open/{SYMBOL}` | Schema Test | 
| 5 | `/api/v2/close/{SYMBOL}` | Schema Test |  
| 6 | `/api/v2/high/{SYMBOL}` | Schema Test | 
| 7 | `/api/v2/low/{SYMBOL}` | Schema Test | 
| 8 | `/api/v4/back_test` | Schema Test |
| 9 | `v1`, `v2` and `v4` | One route of each `v`-type to test a missing API Key |
| 10 | `/api/v2/{YEAR}` | Incorrect year |
| 11 | `v1`, `v2` and `v4` | One route of each `v`-type to test an _invalid_ API Key |
| 12 | `/api/v4/back_test` | Exact Test |

### Specifications:

- You do NOT need to use type hints for this project. If want to experiment with type hints on some functions that is totally fine. Your grade will not be affected if you have some functions with type hints and some functions without type hints. 
- Your documentation will be read over for grammar. Make sure that you are consistent in tense and usage. 
- All functions in your code need to have proper documentation. You need to make sure that your autodocs build is able to find all of the required files and processes them appropriately.

#### Updates to Make / Docker
- There are not changes to the dockerfile, but there are two changes required additional make commands required. 
- `make autodocs` should build and start the `mkdocs` server on port 4040 (externally). When `make autodocs` is running it should be possible to go to the local server and see the autodocs server running.
- `make tests` should run the python test suite as described above making sure to report the coverage reports using `pytest-cov`.

#### Additional Details

- Please make sure to go back to the original specification for the entire API. As part of the final review another look at all of these will be completed. This final look will be deeper than what was originally undertaken. 
- If you wish to receive a solid score go back and verify against the original rubric the standard that you are checking for. 
- You are welcome to add any additional tests, just make sure that the 13 tests above follow the standards previously defined.
- **Make sure that your database is not in the repository** The database needs to be generated by the user.
- If you wish to receive a solid score, make sure that the code works before submitting. I would strongly recommend deleting and re-cloning the repo, making sure that everything works correctly from a clean start.

### Additional Fixes

Please correct all of the feedback for Part VII. A portion of the grade will be set to making sure that your code continues to pass those standards.

## How will this be graded

- We will check out the code at the commit hash that you submit.
- All of the previous coding standards will be checked and the all of the previous APIs (`v1`, `v2` and `v3` and `v4`) will also be tested.
- Your code will also be read over to make sure that it conforms to the standards laid out in class. If you want to receive full credit make sure that your code has sound logic, is easy to read, maintains a good separation of concerns and does not violate the DRY principle.
- We will run the `make` commands outlined above and verify that they work according to the standards set out above. 
- We will run an autograder on the endpoints to make sure that they return the correct data and information. This includes types and casing.
- Finally, your code will also be read to make sure that all documentation is up to date and that the code has a consistent set of abstraction standards. 
- No errors or warning should occur in normal operations.
- The database file itself should _NOT_ be committed to the repo.
- You should never load the entire dataset into a dataframe. You need to use sql commands to only select the relevant data.
