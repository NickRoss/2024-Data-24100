\noindent \textbf{Instructions:} Please answer the following questions below making sure to write your answers legibly. If you run out of room or need to re-write please use the back of this quiz. Put your name on the line above.

The graphic on the left denotes the file system on a machine that we are using. We will use it to answer the questions below. A few important notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item On the graphic \underline{directories} are underlined.
    \item Any other object should be considered a file.
    \item \textbf{For each question assume that you are starting from the original file system}. You should ignore any changes to the file system you made in previous questions.
    \item You will be graded for being unnecessarily complex in your solutions. 
    \item While you are welcome to use \texttt{bash} syntax we have not learned in class I will be testing any solution \emph{on my machine}. If it does not work or requires a non-standard package you will not receive credit.
    \item Unless otherwise stated all questions are worth the same number of points.
    \item All of the answers should be completed in a single line.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Please delete the file \texttt{videoB.mov}. You can assume that your current working directory is \texttt{/users/nick}.
\vspace{1.25cm}
\item Your current working directory is \texttt{/users/nick} please move all the \texttt{.mov} files in the \texttt{my\_docs} sub-directory to the \texttt{videos} directory. Use either absolute or relative path.
\vspace{1.25cm}
\item Your current working directory is \texttt{/users/nick/}. Please return all \emph{lines} in \texttt{LittleWomen.txt} which have the word \texttt{love} in it. This should be a case-insensitive search.
\vspace{1.25cm}
\item The directory \texttt{/users/tim/scripts} has over 200 files in it (which is why they are not shown in the diagram). Your current working directory is \texttt{/users/tim}. Please create a file \texttt{/users/tim/dir\_list.txt} which contains a list of all files (including hidden) in the \texttt{/users/tim/scripts} directory.

\vspace{1.25cm}
\item You are currently in the \texttt{/users/nick/logs} sub-directory. Using a \emph{relative} path, list all the \texttt{.log} files which are in the \texttt{/users/nick/my\_docs} sub-directory.
